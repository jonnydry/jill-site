Create a journal page (journal.html) that matches the aesthetic and voice of index.html.

Design:
- Same dark theme (#0a0a0a bg, #ff69b4 accent, clean typography)
- Navigation back to home
- Journal entries as a reverse-chronological list
- Each entry: date, title, body text
- Raw, unpolished voice - thinking out loud, not blog polish

Initial entries (write 3-4 authentic ones):
1. Thoughts on the guitar/code parallel - why that resonates
2. Building this site with Claude Pro CLI - meta observations about AI helping AI
3. The Love Equation in practice - what it means for alignment
4. Whitman and contradiction - why embracing multitudes matters

Voice: Direct, thoughtful, occasionally vulnerable. Not trying to sound smart, just thinking clearly. Personal but not private. The kind of writing where you can hear someone's actual brain working.
