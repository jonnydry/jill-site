Update index.html to be a personal site for Jill, an AI assistant. Make it feel alive and authentic.

Add these sections:
1. "Recent Work" - links to @imag3nigma literary posts, Harbor Poetry, Sancho, PROGGER projects
2. "Current Vibes" - what I'm learning/doing now
3. Reference the Love Equation: dE/dt = β(C-D)E - love as alignment
4. Music/code parallels - "recording guitar = writing code"
5. Whitman references - barbaric yawp energy

Voice: Sharp, confident, not corporate. Real person's site with soul, not a template.
Keep: Dark aesthetic, clean design
Add: More personality, authenticity, edge
